About Hibernate Settings in application.properties file:

The Hibernate dialect is an important configuration property when using Hibernate 
with a relational database. It tells Hibernate about the specific database 
you are using, and it helps Hibernate generate SQL queries that are compatible 
with that database.

It's generally a good practice to explicitly set the dialect 
for the database you are using.

By specifying the hibernate.dialect property, you inform Hibernate 
about the database you are using, and it will adjust its behavior accordingly.


Importance of DTO Data Transfer Objects:

Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) in Spring RESTful Web API applications serve as 
containers for transferring data between different layers of the application, 
typically between the server (backend) and the client (frontend). 

Here's a brief overview of their importance:

1. Encapsulation:
DTOs encapsulate and represent the data being transferred, allowing for a 
clear separation between the internal data model of the application and the 
data exposed through the API.

2. Decoupling:
They decouple the internal representation of data from its representation in the API, 
ensuring that changes in the application's internal data structure don't directly 
affect the API contract.

3. Reducing Over-fetching and under-fetching:
DTOs help tailor the response to the specific needs of the client, preventing 
over-fetching (retrieving unnecessary data) and under-fetching 
(not retrieving enough data). 

4. Security:
DTOs allow for the exclusion of sensitive information from API responses, 
enhancing security by controlling what data is exposed externally.

In summary, DTOs play a crucial role in maintaining a clean architecture, 
ensuring flexibility, and enhancing communication between different components of 
Spring RESTful Web API applications. They contribute to better maintainability, 
versioning support, and efficient data transfer in distributed systems.

About the benefits of ResponseEntity in controller class:

'ResponseEntity' in your controller methods provides fine-grained control over the 
HTTP response, allowing you to set status codes, headers, and response bodies based 
on specific requirements. It enhances the expressiveness and flexibility of your 
Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux controllers.

@RequestBody annotation is used to indicate that the 'empEntity' parameter should be bound
to the request body, and Spring will attempt to deserialize the JSON payload into an instance
of 'EmployeeEntity'.
